# Gulp devstack

Website devstack using Gulp automation toolkit.</br>
</br>
With effort to keep good ability to read, maintain and extend stack, I keep config, plugins list and tasks definitions in external files organised in **gulp/** folder.</br>
</br>
Stack processes source files to distribution folder, which can be specified in **gulp/config.js** and is set to **test/** in default.</br>
